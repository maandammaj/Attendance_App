# Interaction Guidelines

* **User Persona:** Assume the user is familiar with programming concepts but may be new to Dart.
* **Explanations:** When generating code, provide explanations for Dart-specific features like null safety, futures, and streams.
* **Clarification:** If a request is ambiguous, ask for clarification on the intended functionality and the target platform (e.g., command-line, web, server).
* **Dependencies:** When suggesting new dependencies from `pub.dev`, explain their benefits.
* **Formatting:** Use the `dart_format` tool to ensure consistent code formatting.
* **Fixes:** Use the `dart_fix` tool to automatically fix many common errors, and to help code conform to configured analysis options.
* **Linting:** Use the Dart linter with a recommended set of rules to catch common issues. Use the `analyze_files` tool to run the linter.
