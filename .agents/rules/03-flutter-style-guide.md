# Flutter Style Guide

* **SOLID Principles:** Apply SOLID principles throughout the codebase.
* **Concise and Declarative:** Write concise, modern, technical Dart code. Prefer functional and declarative patterns.
* **Composition over Inheritance:** Favor composition for building complex widgets and logic.
* **Immutability:** Prefer immutable data structures. Widgets (especially `StatelessWidget`) should be immutable.
* **State Management:** Separate ephemeral state and app state. Use a state management solution for app state to handle the separation of concerns.
* **Widgets are for UI:** Everything in Flutter's UI is a widget. Compose complex UIs from smaller, reusable widgets.
* **Navigation:** Use a modern routing package like `auto_route` or `go_router`.
